# 01- Summarization

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, I will be able to:
- **Specific**: To learn how to configure OSPF summarization on Cisco routers via CLI and configuration files.
- **Measurable**: I will complete the OSPF summarization lab and successfully configure summarization on a test network.
- **Achievable**: I have access to the necessary lab equipment through CML and startup configs to implement OSPF summarization
- **Relevant**: Learning OSPF summarization will enhance my understanding of routing protocols and improve my network design skills.
- **Time-bound**: This lab will be completed within 2 hours, including setup, configuration, and testing.

## Lab Instructions
1. **Setup**: Clone the lab repository and navigate to the `01-summarization` folder. Review the provided startup configurations for the routers in the lab topology.
2. **Configuration**: Follow the instructions in the README file to configure OSPF summarization on the appropriate routers. Use the CLI to apply the necessary commands and verify your configuration.
3. **Testing**: After configuring summarization, test the network connectivity and routing tables to ensure that the summarization is working as expected.
